# 1. Exploration of the Data/ Summary of the Data:

# 2. Annotation of the Picture:
   
As a group we agreed to rate the various datasets based on the number of hairs that were present on the image and not solely on the lesions.
   
 Below are some examples of data were we collectively agreed had the ssme ratings:
   
  ![img_0917](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e886e7e-c603-42fd-8662-dd8d6a1d2aa7)
 - We agreed that this image had a rating of 1 due to the presence of some hair.
   
 ![img_0918](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73e4147b-0fce-45ba-9e3a-ed223c744dec)
 - We gave this a rating of 2 because it contains a lot of hair.
  
 ![img_0919](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6992880a-4b9e-438c-9d20-fd3b4082a3ce)
 - A rating of 0 was given because there was no hair found.

##  Disagreement:

-  With this particular image, the group had 3 different ratings on the image. As mentioned above, there was an agreement to rate the number of hairs present in the image but clearly some of us also focused on the image present on the lesion and therefore disregarded the hair present which we assumed to be the persons actual hair.
